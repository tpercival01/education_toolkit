# Aletheia Toolkit: Empowering Digital Literacy Against AI-Generated Content

---

## About the Project

The Aletheia Toolkit is a web-based interactive educational platform developed as part of an MSc in Artificial Intelligence dissertation. Its primary objective is to enhance digital literacy by teaching users how to identify and understand AI-generated content across various media types.

## Purpose & Vision

In an increasingly sophisticated digital landscape, artificial intelligence models are capable of producing highly realistic text, images, audio, and video. This proliferation presents significant challenges in discerning genuine information from AI-fabricated content, particularly for younger internet users and the general public who may have limited prior knowledge.

The vision of the Aletheia Toolkit is to empower these users with the practical skills and conceptual understanding required to confidently navigate this evolving digital reality. By providing an accessible, engaging, and evidence-based learning experience, the toolkit aims to foster a more informed and secure online environment for everyone, reducing susceptibility to AI-driven misinformation.

## Key Features (Educational Toolkit MVP)

This Minimal Viable Product (MVP) focuses solely on the educational component, offering a robust learning experience:

*   **Modular Learning:** Structured into four distinct modules: Text, Images, Audio, and Video, each focusing on specific detection heuristics for that modality.
*   **Interactive Examples:** Side-by-side comparisons and curated examples showcasing both authentic and AI-generated content.
*   **Engaging Quizzes:** Multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop exercises, and "spot the difference" challenges to reinforce learning.
*   **Confidence Calibration:** A unique feature allowing users to rate their confidence in their answers, providing valuable feedback on their self-assessment accuracy.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor their completion of modules and overall progress through the toolkit.
*   **Final Assessment:** A comprehensive test combining challenges from all modalities to evaluate overall skill improvement.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimised for seamless use across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Real-World Case Studies:** Integration of examples inspired by or drawn from actual instances of AI-generated content to enhance relevance.

## Technology Stack

The Aletheia Toolkit is built with modern web technologies for a dynamic and interactive user experience:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
    *   **CSS3:** For styling, leveraging CSS Variables for the "Aletheia Horizon" colour scheme and responsive design (`@media` queries).
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactivity and logic.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   **Local Storage:** For saving user progress and basic quiz results within the browser.

## Installation & Setup

To use the Aletheia toolkit:

1.  **Access the website:**
    Just simply go to this website to access: 

## Usage

Once the application is running:

*   **Homepage:** Provides an introduction and a clear call to action to begin learning.
*   **Modules:** Navigate through dedicated sections for Text, Images, Audio, and Video to learn detection heuristics and view examples.
*   **Quizzes:** Engage with interactive quizzes at the end of each module to test your understanding.
*   **Progress:** Monitor your learning journey and module completion.

## Project Status

This project is currently an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** under active development for an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence dissertation** (due January 6th, 2026). The primary focus is on developing and rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of the educational toolkit.

## Future Enhancements

While the current scope is focused on the educational toolkit MVP, planned future enhancements beyond the dissertation include:

*   Integration into a browser extension for real-time content analysis.
*   Deployment of heavier AI detection models on a backend server.
*   Advanced gamification features within the toolkit.
*   Expansion of content with more varied and challenging examples.
